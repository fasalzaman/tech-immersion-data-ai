## Technology overview

![Big Data Clusters overview.](media/bdc-overview.png 'SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters')

SQL Server 2019 brings innovative security and compliance features, industry leading performance, mission-critical availability, and advanced analytics to all data workloads, now with support for big data built-in.

SQL Server 2019 is a hub for data integration. Data virtualization allows queries across relational and non-relational data without movement or replication. The enhanced PolyBase feature of SQL Server 2019 is able to connect to Hadoop clusters, Oracle, Teradata, MongoDB, and more.

Customers will be able to deliver transformational insights over structured and unstructured data with the power of SQL Server, Hadoop and Spark. SQL Server 2019 big data clusters offer scalable compute and storage composed of SQL Server, Spark and HDFS. Big data clusters will also cache data in scale-out data marts.

![SQL and Spark easily access the data lake.](media/sql-data-lake.png 'Managed SQL Server, Spark, and data lake')

SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters include a storage pool that consists of storage nodes comprised of SQL Server on Linux, Spark, and HDFS. All the storage nodes in a SQL big data cluster are members of a scalable HDFS cluster. These components of the storage pool can be combined to create a data lake to store big data, potentially ingested from multiple, disparate external sources. This data can be either structured or unstructured data. Once the big data is stored in HDFS in the big data cluster, you can analyze and query the data and combine it with your relational data.

SQL Server 2019 is a complete AI platform to train and operationalize R and Python models in SQL Server Machine Learning Services or Spark ML using Azure Data Studio notebooks.

SQL Server 2019 will give customers and ISVs the choice of programming language and platform. They will be able to build modern applications with innovative features using .NET, PHP, Node.JS, Java, Python, Ruby, and more – and deploy the application on either Windows, Linux, or containers both on-premises and in the cloud. Application developers are now able to run Java code on SQL Server and store and analyze graph data.

SQL Server 2019 allows customers to run real-time analytics on operational data using HTAP (Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing), leverage the in-memory technologies for faster transactions and analytical queries, and get higher concurrency and scale through persistent memory.

## Scenario overview

Contoso Auto stores data in several data stores, including relational databases, NoSQL databases, data warehouses, and unstructured data stored in a data lake. They have heard of data virtualization in SQL Server 2019, and are interested to see whether this feature will allow them to more easily access their data stored in these disparate locations. They have heard of the new Big Data Clusters that can be scaled out to handle their Big Data workloads, including machine learning tasks and advanced analytics. They are also interested in any performance improvements against their internal SQL tables by moving to 2019, since the overall amount of data is growing at a rapid pace.

This experience will highlight the new features of SQL Server 2019 with a focus on Big Data Clusters and data virtualization. You will gain hands-on experience with querying both structured and unstructured data in a unified way using T-SQL. This capability will be illustrated by joining different data sets, such as product stock data in flat CSV files in Azure Storage, product reviews stored in Azure SQL Database, and transactional data in SQL Server 2019 for exploratory data analysis within Azure Data Studio. This joined data will be prepared into a table used for reporting, highlighting query performance against this table due to intelligent query processing. With the inclusion of Apache Spark packaged with Big Data Clusters, it is now possible to use Spark to train machine learning models over data lakes and use those models in SQL Server in one system. You will learn how to use Azure Data Studio to work with Jupyter notebooks to train a simple model that can predict vehicle battery lifetime, score new data and save the result as an external table. Finally, you will experience the data security and compliance features provided by SQL Server 2019 by using the Data Discovery & Classification tool in SSMS to identify tables and columns with PII and GDPR-related compliance issues, then address the issues by layering on dynamic data masking to identified columns.

    ![The Connection form is filled out with the previously mentioned settings entered into the appropriate fields.](media/ads-new-connection.png 'Azure Data Studio - New Connection')

4.  Click **Connect**.

## Task 1: Query and join data from flat files, data from external database systems, and SQL Server

One of the key new features of SQL Server 2019 is data virtualization. What this means is that you can _virtualize_ external data in a SQL Server instance, regardless of source, location, and format, so that it can be queried like any other table, or sets of tables, within your SQL Server instance. In essence, data virtualization helps you create a single "virtual" layer of data from these disparate sources, providing unified data services to support multiple applications and users. A more familiar term we could use is data lake, or perhaps data hub. Unlike a typical data lake, however, you do not have to move data out from where it lives, yet you can still query that data through a consistent interface. This is a huge advantage over traditional ETL (extract-transform-load) processes where data must be moved from its original source to a new destination, oftentimes with some data transformation or mapping. This causes delays, extra storage, additional security, and a fair amount of engineering in most cases. With data virtualization, no data movement is required, which means the data sets are up-to-date, and it is possible to query and join these different data sources through these new capabilities, thanks to the use of new [PolyBase](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/polybase/polybase-guide?view=sql-server-ver15) connectors. The data sources you can connect to include Cosmos DB, SQL Server (including Azure SQL Database), Oracle, HDFS (for flat files), and DB2.

![Data Virtualization compared to traditional ETL.](media/data-virtualization-vs-etl.png 'ETL vs. Data Virtualization')

The image to the left represents traditional data movement using ETL. Compare that to data virtualization, which does not require data movement and provides a unified layer over top of existing data sources.

In this task, you will experience how to configure data virtualization in SQL Server 2019 by joining data in a single query from a SQL Server 2019 table, an external file stored in HDFS (Hadoop Filesystem), and an external database.

Learn more about using data virtualization with [relational data sources](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/polybase/data-virtualization?toc=%2fsql%2fbig-data-cluster%2ftoc.json&view=sql-server-ver15) and [CSV files](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/polybase/data-virtualization-csv?view=sql-server-ver15), using the External Table Wizard.

To start, we will use the External Table Wizard in Azure Data Studio to connect to an external Azure SQL Database.

1.  Open Azure Data Studio and connect to your SQL Server 2019 cluster, following the [connection steps](#connect-with-azure-data-studio) above.

2.  Expand the Databases folder, right-click on the **sales_YOUR_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER** database, then select **Create New Query**. The `YOUR_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER` portion of the name is the unique identifier assigned to you for this lab.

    ![The sales database and the Create External Table sub-menu item are highlighted.](media/ads-create-external-table-sales.png 'Create External Table')

3.  Paste the following script into the query window:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL [SqlCred] WITH IDENTITY = 'SQLReader', SECRET = 'MySQLBigData2019';
    GO
    CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE [SqlSource]
    WITH (LOCATION = N'sqlserver://tech-immersion-sqlsrv.database.windows.net:1433', CREDENTIAL = [SqlCred], CONNECTION_OPTIONS='DATABASE=CA_Commerce');
    GO
    IF NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM sys.external_tables WHERE name = 'reviews')
    BEGIN
        CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE [dbo].[Reviews](
            [product_id] [bigint] NOT NULL,
            [customer_id] [bigint] NOT NULL,
            [review] [nvarchar](1000) NOT NULL,
            [date_added] [datetime] NOT NULL
        )
        WITH
        (
            DATA_SOURCE = SqlSource,
            LOCATION = 'CA_Commerce.dbo.Reviews'
        );
    END
    ```

4.  Click **Run** at the top of the query window to execute:

    ![The SQL query is displayed in the query window and the Run button is highlighted.](media/ads-virtual-sql-table-query.png 'Query window')

5.  After a few moments, you will see three messages stating that the commands completed successfully.

    ![The three success messages are displayed.](media/ads-virtual-sql-table-query-success.png 'Messages window')

6.  Select the Servers link (Ctrl+G) on the left-hand menu, then expand the Tables list underneath your **sales_YOUR_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER** database and find the **dbo.Reviews (External)** table. If you do not see it, right-click on the Tables folder, then select Refresh. The "(External)" portion of the table name denotes that it is a virtual data object that was added as an external table.

    ![The Reviews external table is displayed in the sales tables list.](media/ads-reviews-table-in-list.png 'Reviews external table')

7.  Right-click the **dbo.Reviews (External)** table, then select the **Select Top 1000** menu option to display the table contents.

    ![The Select Top 1000 rows menu item is highlighted.](media/ads-reviews-select-top-1000.png 'Select Top 1000')

8.  You should see a SQL query selecting the top 1000 records from the Reviews table and its results. The interesting thing to note is that the query selects the table and fields using the same syntax you would use to select from any other table in the sales database. The fact that the Reviews table is external is completely seamless and transparent to the user. This is the power of data virtualization in SQL Server 2019.

    ![The Reviews query and results are displayed.](media/ads-reviews-query-results.png 'Reviews query results')

    ```sql
    SELECT TOP (1000) [product_id]
        ,[customer_id]
        ,[review]
        ,[date_added]
    FROM [sales_YOUR_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER].[dbo].[Reviews]
    ```

9.  The next data source we will be virtualizing is a CSV file that was uploaded to HDFS.

10. Within Azure Data Studio, scroll down below the list of SQL Server 2019 databases to find the **Data Services** folder. Expand that folder, expand the **HDFS** folder, then expand the **data** subfolder. Right-click on the `stockitemholdings.csv` file, then select **Create External Table From CSV Files**.

    ![The CSV file and the Create External Table From CSV Files menu item are highlighted.](media/ads-create-external-table-csv.png 'Create External Table From CSV Files')

11. In the Create External Table from CSV dialog, confirm that the **sales** database is selected and that the name of the external table is **stockitemholdings**.

    ![The previously mentioned form is displayed.](media/ads-external-table-csv-wizard-active-connection.png 'Active SQL Server connections')

12. Click **Next**.

13. The next step displays a preview of the first 50 rows CSV data for validation. Click **Next** to continue.

    ![A preview of the CSV data is displayed.](media/ads-external-table-csv-preview.png 'Preview Data')

14. In the next step, you will be able to modify the columns of the external table you intend to create. You are able to alter the column name, change the data type, and allow for Nullable rows. For now, leave everything as-is and click **Next**.

    ![The Modify Columns step is displayed.](media/ads-external-table-csv-modify.png 'Modify Columns')

15. Verify that everything looks correct in the Summary step, then click **Create Table**.

    ![The Summary step is displayed.](media/ads-external-table-csv-create.png 'Summary')

16. As with the previous external table you created, a "Create External Table succeeded" dialog will appear under your task history in a few moments. Select the Servers link (Ctrl+G) on the left-hand menu, then expand the Tables list underneath your **sales_YOUR_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER** database and find the **dbo.stockitemholdings (External)** table. If you do not see it, right-click on the Tables folder, then select Refresh. **Right-click** the **dbo.stockitemholdings (External)** table, then select **Select Top 1000** from the context menu.

    ![The Select Top 1000 rows menu item is highlighted.](media/ads-stockitemholdings-select-top-1000.png 'Select Top 1000')

17. Just as before, you should see a SQL query selecting the top 1000 rows and its query results, this time from the `stockitemholdings` table. Again, the SQL query is the same type of query you would write to select from a table internal to the sales database.

    ![The stockitemholdings query and results are displayed.](media/ads-stockitemholdings-results.png 'Stockitemholdings results')

    ```sql
    SELECT TOP (1000) [StockItemID]
        ,[QuantityOnHand]
        ,[BinLocation]
        ,[LastStocktakeQuantity]
        ,[LastCostPrice]
        ,[ReorderLevel]
        ,[TargetStockLevel]
        ,[LastEditedBy]
        ,[LastEditedWhen]
    FROM [sales_YOUR_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER].[dbo].[stockitemholdings]
    ```

18. Now that we have our two external tables added, we will now join those two external tables and two internal tables with a new SQL query to demonstrate how you can seamlessly combine all these data sources without having to copy any files or with separate queries or additional processing of that data. **Right-click** the **sales_YOUR_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER** database, then select **New Query**.

    ![The sales database and New Query menu item are highlighted.](media/ads-new-query.png 'New Query')

19. Paste the following into the new query window:

    ```sql
    SELECT i.i_item_sk AS ItemID, i.i_item_desc AS Item, c.c_first_name AS FirstName,
      c.c_last_name AS LastName, s.QuantityOnHand, r.review AS Review, r.date_added AS DateReviewed
    FROM dbo.item as i
    JOIN dbo.Reviews AS r ON i.i_item_sk = r.product_id
    JOIN dbo.customer AS c ON c.c_customer_sk = r.customer_id
    JOIN dbo.stockitemholdings AS s ON i.i_item_sk = s.StockItemID
    ```

20. Click the **Run** button above the query window to execute.

    ![The Run button above the query window is highlighted.](media/ads-run.png 'Run')

21. At the bottom of the query window, you will see results that include columns from the four data sources.

    ![Query results from the four data sets.](media/ads-query-results.png 'Query results')

## Task 2: Train a machine learning model, score and save data as external table

In this task, you will use Azure Data Studio to execute a notebook that will enable you to train a model to predict the battery lifetime, apply the model to make batch predictions against a set of vehicle telemetry and save the scored telemetry to an external table that you can query using SQL.

1. In Azure Data Studio, click **File**, then **Open File...**.

2. In the folder browser dialog, navigate to the **C:\Labfiles** folder and select **predict-battery-life-with-sqlbdc.ipynb**.

3. When the notebook opens, you need to select the **Kernel** you would like to use to run the notebook. Locate the **Kernel** dropdown in the toolbar above the notebook, then select **PySpark3**.

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook and return to the next step after you have completed the notebook.

   > There may be a kernel error pertaining to there not being a valid SQL connection when you open the notebook. If this happens, close the notebook and Azure Data Studio, then re-launch, reconnect, then re-open the notebook.

5. In Azure Data Studio, under Servers, expand your Big Data Cluster, `Data Services`, `HDFS`, `data`.

6. Right click the `data` folder and select `Refresh` to see the newly created folder.

   ![Refresh data](media/task02-refresh-data.png 'Refresh data')

7. You should see `battery-life-YOUR_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER.csv` as a folder (where `YOUR_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER` is your assigned identifier), expand it and then right click on the CSV file whose name starts with `part-00000-` and select `Create External Table From CSV Files`.

   ![Create External Table](media/task02-create-external-menu.png 'Create External Table')

8. In Step 1 of the wizard, select the `sales_YOUR_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER` database and for the `Name for new external table` field provide **battery-life-predictions**. Click **Next**.

   ![Step 1 of the wizard is displayed.](media/ads-predictions-csv-wizard-step1.png 'Step 1')

9. On Step 2, Preview Data, click **Next**.

10. On Step 3, for the column `Car_Has_EcoStart` set the Data Type to **char(10)**. Click **Next**.

    ![Step 3 of the wizard is displayed.](media/ads-predictions-csv-wizard-step3.png 'Step 3')

11. On Step, click **Create Table**. Your predictions are now available for SQL querying in the battery-life-predictions table in the sales database.

12. In Azure Data Studio, Servers, expand your Big Data Cluster, `Databases`, `sales_YOUR-UNIQUE-IDENTIFIER`, right click `Tables` and then select `Refresh`.

    ![Refresh sales](media/task02-refresh-sales.png 'Refresh sales')

13. Expand `tables`, right click `battery-life-prediction` and select `query` to view the data contained by the external table.

    ![Select Top 1000](media/task02-select-top.png 'Select Top 1000')

14. The vehicle telemetry along with predictions will appear. These are queried from the external table which is sourced from the CSV you created using the notebook.

    ![View data](media/task02-view-data.png 'View data')

## Task 3: Mounting an Azure Data Lake Gen2 Storage Account to SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster using HDFS Tiering

![SQL and Spark easily access the data lake.](media/sql-data-lake.png 'Managed SQL Server, Spark, and data lake')

SQL Server 2019 storage pools help you create a data lake by storing data in scalable, shared storage provided by Hadoop File System (HDFS). Store high volume data in this layer and access it easily using either SQL or Apache Spark. You can expand your HDFS storage by using tiering.

HDFS also provides data persistency, as HDFS data is spread across all the storage nodes in the SQL big data cluster. However, you can add external HDFS data sources to the HDFS cluster through tiering. With tiering, applications can seamlessly access data in a variety of external stores as though the data resides in the local HDFS. This allows you to interact with the files in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 or Amazon S3 as if they were local files. Both options allow you to mount the data store using storage keys. However, with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2, you can either use an Azure Storage access key or an Azure Active Directory User Account to gain permission to the files. For this lab, we will use the access key.

1. In Windows, open the Windows Command Prompt.

2. Connect to your Microsoft SQL Server 2019 Big Data Cluster:

   ```python
   mssqlctl login -e https://<SQL SERVER Controller IP ADDRESS>:30080
   ```

   - You will be prompted for your big data cluster name.
   - The user name is admin
   - The password is MySQLBigData2019

3. Execute the following in the command prompt to set a new environment variable with the ADLS Gen2 account name and access key credentials:

   ```text
   set MOUNT_CREDENTIALS=fs.azure.abfs.account.name=techimmersionde2storage.dfs.core.windows.net,fs.azure.account.key.techimmersionde2storage.dfs.core.windows.net=XbrGm8b5+C20BSKviD0KJipxXorq7oMEb6Ba6l3q4RjvgBPajucK9UOX3RyT5M0y9XelymiXN0onxoWB/9So4g==
   ```

4. Execute the following in the command prompt to mount the drive. Replace the YOUR_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER portion with the unique identifier assigned to you for this lab.:

   ```powershell
   azdata bdc hdfs mount create --remote-uri abfs://dbfiles@techimmersionde2storage.dfs.core.windows.net/ --mount-path /mounts/dbfiles-YOUR_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER
   ```

5. Once the storage account has been mounted, you can check the status:

   ```powershell
   azdata bdc hdfs mount status
   ```

   ![The mount status is displayed in the command window.](media/cmd-mount-status.png 'Mount status')

6. Now you can use Azure Data Studio and view the files from ADLS Gen2 under your HDFS folder in your Servers pane. Look under /HDFS/mounts/dbfiles/

   ![Azure Data Studio server pane for new dbfiles folder](media/data-studio-mounts.png 'Azure Data Studio mounts')

7. Now that the drive is mounted, create an external file format for CSV. Open a new query window and paste the following command. Replace **sales_YOUR_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER** with the name of your unique sales database. The `YOUR_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER` portion of the name is the unique identifier assigned to you for this lab.

   ```sql
   USE sales_YOUR_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER;
   GO
   CREATE EXTERNAL FILE FORMAT csv_file
   WITH (
       FORMAT_TYPE = DELIMITEDTEXT,
       FORMAT_OPTIONS(
           FIELD_TERMINATOR = ',',
           STRING_DELIMITER = '"',
           FIRST_ROW = 2,
           USE_TYPE_DEFAULT = TRUE)
   );
   ```

8. Now create an external connection to your HDFS cluster:

   ```sql
   IF NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM sys.external_data_sources WHERE name = 'SqlStoragePool')
   BEGIN
   CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE SqlStoragePool
   WITH (LOCATION = 'sqlhdfs://controller-svc:8080/default');
   END
   ```

9. Now let's create two tables to two different files that exist in the storage account:


    ```sql
    CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE planes
    ("tailnum" VARCHAR(100),	"year" VARCHAR(4),	"type" VARCHAR(100)
    ,	"manufacturer" VARCHAR(100),	"model" VARCHAR(20),	"engines" BIGINT
    ,	"seats" BIGINT,	"speed" VARCHAR(20)
    ,	"engine" VARCHAR(20))
    WITH
    (
        DATA_SOURCE = SqlStoragePool,
        LOCATION = '/mounts/dbfiles/planes.csv',
        FILE_FORMAT = csv_file
    );
    GO

    CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE flights
    ("year" BIGINT, 	"month" BIGINT, 	"day" BIGINT,	"dep_time" BIGINT
        ,	"dep_delay" BIGINT,	"arr_time" BIGINT,	"arr_delay" BIGINT,	"carrier" VARCHAR(100)
        ,	"tailnum" VARCHAR(20),	"flight" VARCHAR(20),	"origin" VARCHAR(50)
        ,	"dest" VARCHAR(50),	"air_time" BIGINT,	"distance" BIGINT,
          "hour" BIGINT,	"minute" BIGINT)
    WITH
    (
        DATA_SOURCE = SqlStoragePool,
        LOCATION = '/mounts/dbfiles/flights_small.csv',
        FILE_FORMAT = csv_file
    );
    ```

10. Once the tables are created, you can interact with them like normal tables. For instance, you can run a query that joins the two tables like this:

    ```sql
    SELECT *
      FROM planes p
      JOIN flights f
        on p.tailnum = f.tailnum
    ```

## Wrap-up

Thank you for participating in the SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters experience! We hope you are excited about the new capabilities, and will refer back to this experience to learn more about these features.

To recap, you experienced:

1. How to minimize or remove the need for ETL through **data virtualization** with [relational data sources](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/polybase/data-virtualization?toc=%2fsql%2fbig-data-cluster%2ftoc.json&view=sql-server-ver15) and [CSV files](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/polybase/data-virtualization-csv?view=sql-server-ver15), by being able to query against these alongside internal SQL 2019 tables with no data movement required.
2. Training a machine learning model by running a Jupyter notebook on the Big Data cluster, then scoring data with the trained model and saving it as an external table for easy access.
3. You learned to use HDFS tiering to mount files from an Azure Data Lake Store Gen2 account, which allowed you to create tables from files as if they were local to the cluster.
